# Luna Lights – Cloud Data Engineering Project

This project demonstrates a realistic **ETL pipeline** for an e-commerce business, from raw data processing to analysis and visualization.

## Project Overview
Luna Lights is a fictional e-commerce store that sells lamps and ambient lighting products.  
The goal of this project is to showcase **data engineering and analytics skills** using Python, Pandas, and Jupyter Notebook.

## Repository Structure
- `data/raw/` – raw CSV files (sales, customers, products, exchange rates)  
- `data/processed/` – cleaned and processed CSV files  
- `scripts/` – Python ETL scripts  
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter Notebooks with visualizations  
- `docs/` – screenshots and project documentation  

## Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Git & GitHub  

## How to Run
1. Run the ETL script to process raw data:
```bash
python3 scripts/transform_sales.py
